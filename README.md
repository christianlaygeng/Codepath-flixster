### Notes
Again with the difference from XCode 8 to XCode 11, it became difficult to drag IBOutlets. The tutorial also used a wide variety of libraries very briefly so it was difficult to keep up with what each did.

### Notes
The update from XCode 8 (in the tutorial) to XCode 11 caused a lot difficulty because certain features in XCode 8 were hidden or removed in XCode 11. This led to a lot of extra time spent trying to reconfigure my XCode screens to work.
